## Evaluating the relationship between games and reviews

This Project was written in collaboration with Paolo Caggiano for the Data Management course in the Master Degree in Data Science.
The problem discusses the relationship between games and reviews. The data has been scraped by both Steam and Metacritic, and then stored in a MongoDb database from which all the steps to integrate the data of the two different sources were taken.
Further information about the decisions we made for the acquisition, storing and integration of the data can be read on the official report.
